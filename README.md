# Oh-My-Profiles
some rule based profiles
## About
As a former user of [clash](https://github.com/Dreamacro/clash) on windows and a current user of [surge](https://nssurge.com) on iOS and macOS, I found it was tough and tedious to find all pieces of profiles. The configuration is so complex that my cause the large consumption of memory. Although there has been serval front-end services available to merge all the rule sets and integrate the configuration file, it's still a good habit to complete your own set of configuration.
## Usage
Thanks to all selfless authors who has written scripts and rules for surge and clash!

A template is in the root directory. Other modules are listed in the labeled directorys. You can choose what you want to install.
